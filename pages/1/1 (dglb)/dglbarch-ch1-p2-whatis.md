Global load balancing is a service that directs inbound connections to a nominal application/service to instances of the actual application/service, typically at geographically dispersed locations.

GLB is distinguished from ALB in that it deals effectively with distributing traffic across multiple physical locations, rather than just across application-instances within a single location. This document attempts to establish a generalized reference architecture for GLB enabled by DNS (dGLB.)
