Global load balancing is a service that directs inbound connections to a *nominal* application/service to *actual* instances of the application/service, typically at geographically dispersed locations and in accordance with a configured traffic-distribution policy .  The global-load-balncing service iteself is typically deployed in a *globally* avaiable manner.

The distinction between "global" and "application" load-balancing is not a precisely defined one.  Depending on your specific use-cases and design objectives, you may find yourself more interested in the *global* nature of the endpoints to which a GLB directs traffic or the *global* nature of the GLB's availability.  (Both are elements that typically differentiate global load-balancing services from "application load balancing services.")
