summary: "To talk about how capacity is 'abstracted' by, and how it presents in relation to: reliability; virtualization; and composability we have to be clear on what we think all those things mean."

This book will establish conceptual frameworks and working definitions for multiple topics (including absraction, reliability, virutalization among others) in it second section.  These concepts and definitions will then be expanded on to develop a capacity-centric architecture framework for IT system architecture in its third section.
