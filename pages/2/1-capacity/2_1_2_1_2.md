## Abstraction in Use

Picture a microsope slide, prepared with a drop of water containing hundreds of amoeba and sugar crystals. Now, imagine that your miscrocope can zoom all the way down to the subatomic scale.

If have the microscope set the sub-atomic scale, you'll see an innumberable number of electrons/protons/neutrons, but at that scale you might just barely be able to infer the existence of an atomic structure. You certainly won't be able to recognize any pseudopods or sugar crystals.
1st Abstraction: Atoms If you zoom out (to "atomic scale"), you won't see electrons/protons/etc any more; you'll see individual atoms, and you'll notice that there seems to be some sort of pattern to how they connect/interact with each other. That "zooming out" has effectively "abstracted" subatomic particles into atoms. It's a \*useful\* abstraction because (with the benefit of a few hundred years of scientific research at your disposal) you can observe (and \*predict\*) the behavior of the atoms without needing direct knowledge of the individual subatomic particles that they are made up of. But, if you want to \*explain\* (understand) the \*mechanism\* of that interaction, you have to drill back down to the subatomic level to see things like the "sharing" of electrons in covalent bonding.
2nd Abstraction: Molecules Zooming out again (to "molecular scale") you'll see a bewildering array of molecules. You've "abstracted" atoms into molecules. Again, it's a \*useful\* abstraction because you are able to infer (or borrow from the collected body of existing human knowledge) a set of patterns that let you predict how the molecules interact with each other.
3rd Abstraction: Organelles Zoom out again, (to the "organelle scale") and now you'll see all these neat structures like mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, and others.
In these examples, the "zoom level" of the microscope is serving as our organizing/selecting filter in the process of abstraction. Zooming in to "subatomic scale" makes organelles and molecules invisible to us, for example.

For a more on-the-nose example, we might wish a collective "good luck" to anyone hoping to understand why a right-click their Windows desktop isn't raising a context menu if they are "zoomed in" and watching machine-code instructions get executed by your CPU.

The real *power* of abstraction though isn't just that it gives us a handy label for referring to groups of things.
