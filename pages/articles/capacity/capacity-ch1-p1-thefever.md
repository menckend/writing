As a network architect, I tend to think about capacity a lot. As a chronic overthinker, I tend to look for patterns. At some point, it dawned on me that conceptually, a non-trivial number of the recurrent design challenges (and decision-points) that network/compute/storage/database/application/etc... engineers and architects face look almost identical, if they are framed in terms of capacity.

Sadly, I didn't really have the language or conceptual frameworks to make any real sense of (or derive value from) that realization. So, I decided I'd better acquire them. This document is what happened when I did.
