I recently found myself needing to establish deployment architecture guidelines for DNS-based global load-balancing services at work, and I wanted to do so in the context of a cogent reference architecture. Not just because that's how I roll, but also because after 20+ years of rattling around the network space, I'd never really gone deep on GLB (and I wanted to have a good idea what I was talking about). I found an abundance of vendor-specific documentation, but wanted a platform-agnostic framework for us to work from, so I put this together.

My intent is that this reference architecture will provide us with a useful perspective as we dig into exactly role dGLB will play in our future-state hybrid/multi-cloud environment as well as providing us with an explicit and direct reference to the specific patterns we seek to implement. (I am not <em>un</em>-prepared for disappointment, though.)

Presented here for you to adore, ignore, or stomp on the floor as you see fit.
