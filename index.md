Hi there; I'm Mencken.  Amongst other things, I'm a: network architect; husband; parent; and musician.  I also enjoy writing, but I haven't really written *just because I wanted to* in about twenty years or so.

I made this site to start hosting some network-architecture-related articles.  I did this after realizing that a lot of the same themes kept popping up as (virtually irresistable) rabbit-holes of distraction when I was trying to get "real work" done. I decided that there must have been some sort of itch I wanted to scratch hiding in those rabbit holes, so I might as well lean into it.

The inaugural document is a generalized reference architecture for DNS-based global load-balancing.  You'll find it (and the subsequent documents/articles from the "Articles" drop-down menu at the top of this page.)

All works presented here are my own, intended for you to adore/ignore (or outright abhor) as you see fit.
