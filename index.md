My name is Mencken; I'm a network architect, a husband, a parent, a musician, and I like writing.

I made this site to start hosting some network-architecture-related articles based on ideas that it took me way too long to realize actually *wanted* to *be* more generalized, longer-form documents. (That is, after I noticed that a lot of the same themes kept popping up irresistable rabbit-holes continually trying to distract me from the more mundane artifacts I was creating on a day-to-day basis.)

The content is sorted into "libraries" (each of which has a drop-down menu on the top navbar, showing the documents in that library.) When you select a document from a library in the topnav dropdown, the document structure is populated in the sidebar menu. The general hierarchy is: Library --> Document --> Chapter --> Page.

The inaugural document is a generalized reference architecture for DNS-based global load-balancing, so hopefully that sort of thing is on your wavelength.

All works presented here are my own, intended for you to adore/ignore (or outright abhor) as you see fit. I certainly *hope* that someone finds value in them, of course.
