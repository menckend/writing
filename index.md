My name is Mencken Davidson. I'm a network architect, husband, parent, musician, and I like writing. I created this site to start hosting some network-architecture-related articles that it took me a few years realize actually *wanted* to be more generalized, longer-form documents. (After I noticed that a lot of the same themes kept popping up as nearly-irresistable rabbit-holes in the more mundane artifacts I was creating on a day-to-day basis.)

All works presented here are my own, and are intended for you to adore/ignore/shove-in-a-drawer (or outright abhor) as you see fit. (I certainly *hope* that someone finds value in them, though.)

The content is sorted into "libraries" (each of which has a drop-down menu on the top navbar), with the contents of each library enumerated and iterated in the sidebar on the left.

The general hierarchy is: Library-->Document-->Chapter-->Page.
